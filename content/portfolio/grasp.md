Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP) is an ancestral sequence reconstruction tool. If you provide it a set of aligned protein sequences and a phylogenetic tree then it calculates the most likely amino acids for the ancestral sequences.

GRASP is capable of processing much greater numbers of sequences than other maximum likelihood ASR tools, and displays ancestors as partial order graphs, allowing for the visualisation of ambiguity in insertions and deletions of content as sequences evolve.

These individual blocks of content implied by the evolving sequences can be used as modules to selectively include or alter and can be used to construct novel ancestral forms that we call 'hybrid ancestors' - inspired from ancestors, but often with different and valuable properties.
