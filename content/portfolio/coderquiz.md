Coder Quiz is an educational tool I developed to assist with the courses Introduction to Bioinformatics and Advanced Bioinformatics at the University of Queensland.

Coder Quiz is an online quiz that automatically runs answers against Python code in order to give real-time feedback during programming practicals.
