Double Blind is a scientific poster competition in which researchers must explain the key results of a scientific project in under 90 seconds.

The catch? The research they are communicating was conducted by another researcher! Researchers compete in teams and receive the poster they will be presenting only 48 hours before the competition.

I created and ran the Double Blind competition during my time serving on the Research Student Advisory Group. It has now been running for over five years as one of the main social engagement events of the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences Research Students Symposium at the University of Queensland.

Double Blind promotes cross-discipline understanding and celebrates posters that are easily accessiable to a general audience. Feedback has been positive and the competition has been well received.
